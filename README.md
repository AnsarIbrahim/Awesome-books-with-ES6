# Awesome-books-with-ES6
Awesome books is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. By building this application, I learnt how to manage data using JavaScript. Thanks to that my website will be more interactive. I also useD a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.
